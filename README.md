My journey into the IT world began with my passion for gaming. Growing up in the 90s with Gameboy and Super Nintendo, I gained early experiences in video games. In my youth, I delved deeper into the world of computer games and IT through games like CS 1.6 and CS: Source. I was even part of a professional team at one point, but ultimately decided against pursuing a career in esports. Today, I still enjoy playing games for fun, with a high level of skill and expertise, particularly in CS: Global Offensive. My gaming background has provided valuable insights into the technical aspects of video games and the IT industry, fueling my passion for software development.
